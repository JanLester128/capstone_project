# Database Cleanup Summary

## **ENROLLMENTS Table Optimization**

### **Removed Unnecessary Columns:**
✅ **`student_name`** - Redundant (can get from users table via relationship)
✅ **`student_lrn`** - Redundant (already have `lrn` column)  
✅ **`last_school_attended`** - Redundant (already have `previous_school` column)
✅ **`user_id`** - Duplicate of `student_id` (model inconsistency fixed)

### **Columns Kept (All Actively Used):**
- `student_id` - Primary foreign key to users table
- `school_year_id` - Foreign key to school_years table
- `grade_level` - Student's grade level (11 or 12)
- `lrn` - Learner Reference Number
- `strand_id` - Assigned strand foreign key
- `assigned_section_id` - Assigned section foreign key
- `student_status` - Regular/Transferee status
- `enrollment_date` - When enrollment was created
- `student_type` - Type of student enrollment
- `previous_school` - Last school attended
- `first_strand_choice_id` - First choice strand
- `second_strand_choice_id` - Second choice strand
- `third_strand_choice_id` - Third choice strand
- `report_card` - Uploaded report card file
- `documents` - JSON array of uploaded documents
- `status` - pending/approved/rejected/enrolled
- `coordinator_id` - Coordinator who reviewed
- `coordinator_notes` - Coordinator's notes
- `reviewed_at` - When review was completed
- `submitted_at` - When enrollment was submitted
- `enrolled_by` - Who enrolled the student (manual enrollment)
- `notes` - Additional notes

### **Summer Enrollment Fields (Used by FullAcademicYearController):**
- `enrollment_type` - regular/summer/transferee
- `summer_subjects` - JSON array of failed subjects for summer
- `schedule_preference` - Summer schedule preference
- `academic_year_status` - in_progress/completed/failed/summer_required

## **Related Tables Optimization**

### **transferee_previous_schools Table:**
✅ **`last_school`** - Reduced from 255 to 100 characters (sufficient for school names)

### **transferee_credited_subjects Table:**
✅ Already optimized - `school_year` (20 chars), `semester` (10 chars)

### **summer_class_schedules Table:**
✅ Already optimized - `room` (100 chars), `schedule_type` (50 chars)

## **Model Updates**

### **Enrollment.php Model:**
✅ **Removed from $fillable:** `user_id`
✅ **Added to $fillable:** `coordinator_notes`, `reviewed_at`, summer fields
✅ **Enhanced $casts:** Added proper casting for datetime and array fields
✅ **Added relationship:** `enrolledBy()` method

### **Controller Updates:**
✅ **EnrollmentController.php:** Fixed `last_school_attended` → `previous_school`

## **Migration Applied:**
✅ **2025_01_21_120000_cleanup_enrollments_and_related_tables.php**
- Safely removes redundant columns with proper rollback support
- Optimizes string lengths for better performance
- Maintains all actively used functionality

## **Database Benefits:**
- ✅ **Reduced Redundancy:** Eliminated duplicate data storage
- ✅ **Better Performance:** Smaller table size, optimized string lengths
- ✅ **Cleaner Schema:** Removed inconsistencies and unused columns
- ✅ **Maintained Functionality:** All active features preserved
- ✅ **Proper Relationships:** Fixed model inconsistencies

## **Files Modified:**
1. `database/migrations/2025_01_21_120000_cleanup_enrollments_and_related_tables.php` - New cleanup migration
2. `app/Models/Enrollment.php` - Updated fillable array, casts, and relationships
3. `app/Http/Controllers/EnrollmentController.php` - Fixed column reference

## **Result:**
The enrollments table is now properly organized with only necessary columns, optimized string lengths, and clean relationships. All summer enrollment and transferee functionality is preserved while eliminating redundant data storage.
