# Faculty Load Management & Academic Calendar System

## Overview

This system implements comprehensive faculty load management and academic calendar functionality for the Laravel + React (Inertia.js) capstone project. It ensures that each faculty member has a maximum of 5 teaching loads per school year or semester, following Nielsen's 10 HCI principles for optimal user experience.

## System Architecture

### Database Structure

#### 1. Faculty Loads Table (`faculty_loads`)
```sql
- id (Primary Key)
- faculty_id (Foreign Key to users)
- school_year_id (Foreign Key to school_years)
- total_loads (Integer, default: 0)
- max_loads (Integer, default: 5)
- is_overloaded (Boolean, default: false)
- load_notes (Text, nullable)
- assigned_by (Foreign Key to users, nullable)
- assigned_at (Timestamp, nullable)
- created_at, updated_at
- UNIQUE constraint on (faculty_id, school_year_id)
```

#### 2. Enhanced School Years Table
```sql
Added fields for Academic Calendar:
- enrollment_start (Date, nullable)
- enrollment_end (Date, nullable)
- quarter_1_start through quarter_4_end (Date, nullable)
- grading_deadline (Date, nullable)
- is_enrollment_open (Boolean, default: false)
```

### Models

#### 1. FacultyLoad Model
- **Relationships**: faculty(), schoolYear(), assignedBy(), classes()
- **Methods**: 
  - `checkOverload()`: Validates if faculty exceeds load limit
  - `updateLoadCount()`: Recalculates total loads from active classes
  - `getRemainingLoadsAttribute()`: Computed remaining capacity
  - `getUtilizationPercentageAttribute()`: Load utilization percentage

#### 2. Enhanced SchoolYear Model
- **New Methods**:
  - `isEnrollmentOpen()`: Checks if enrollment period is active
  - `getCurrentQuarter()`: Returns current quarter (1-4) based on date
  - `isGradingOpen()`: Validates if grading is still allowed
  - `getSemesterInfo()`: Returns complete semester structure information

#### 3. Enhanced User Model
- **New Relationships**: 
  - `facultyLoads()`: All faculty load records
  - `currentFacultyLoad()`: Current active school year load
  - `assignedLoads()`: Loads assigned by this user (registrar)

## Features Implementation

### 1. Load Assignment by Registrar

**Interface**: `FacultyLoadManagement.jsx`
- Visual faculty load overview with utilization percentages
- Real-time load validation and conflict detection
- Drag-and-drop or modal-based assignment interface

**Controller**: `FacultyLoadController.php`
- `assignLoad()`: Creates new class assignments with validation
- `removeLoad()`: Removes class assignments and updates counts
- `updateLoadLimit()`: Adjusts maximum load limits per faculty
- `checkScheduleConflicts()`: Validates time conflicts

**Validation Rules**:
- Maximum 5 loads per faculty (configurable)
- No schedule conflicts (same day/time)
- No duplicate subject-section assignments
- Faculty must exist and have valid role

### 2. Faculty Load Dashboard

**Interface**: `Faculty_LoadDashboard.jsx`
- Personal load utilization display
- Weekly schedule visualization
- Class details with student counts
- Real-time notifications and alerts

**Features**:
- Load utilization percentage with color coding

- `toggleEnrollment()`: Opens/closes enrollment periods
- `getCalendarInfo()`: API for calendar data
- `getEnrollmentPeriods()`: Enrollment status for all years
- `getGradingPeriods()`: Quarter information for faculty

### 4. Notification System

**Controller**: `NotificationController.php`
- Faculty load notifications (overload, near limit, new assignments)
- Registrar notifications (overloaded faculty, unassigned faculty)
- Academic calendar notifications (enrollment periods, grading deadlines)

**Types of Notifications**:
- **Error**: Overloaded faculty, missed deadlines
- **Warning**: Near capacity, approaching deadlines
- **Info**: New assignments, enrollment periods
- **Success**: Successful operations

- Faculty load records created automatically on assignment
- Academic calendar setup through interface

## Testing Scenarios

### Load Assignment Testing
1. Assign loads within limit (should succeed)
2. Attempt to exceed 5-load limit (should fail with validation)
3. Create schedule conflicts (should fail with conflict detection)
4. Remove loads and verify count updates
5. Test bulk assignment operations

### Academic Calendar Testing
1. Set up complete semester structure
2. Test enrollment period toggles
3. Validate quarter date sequences
4. Test grading deadline enforcement
5. Verify notification triggers

### Permission Testing
1. Faculty accessing other faculty loads (should fail)
2. Registrar managing all loads (should succeed)
3. Coordinator viewing own loads (should succeed)
4. Student accessing load management (should fail)

## Performance Considerations
