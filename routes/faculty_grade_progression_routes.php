// âœ… ROUTES SUCCESSFULLY MOVED TO MAIN CONTROLLERS FOLDER
// 
// All Grade 11 to Grade 12 progression routes are now implemented in:
// - Controller: App\Http\Controllers\FacultyController (main Controllers folder)
// - Routes: Already added to routes/web.php
// 
// No separate Faculty subfolder needed - all controllers are in the main Controllers directory
// 
// Available routes:
// - GET  /faculty/grade11-students     -> FacultyController@getGrade11Students
// - POST /faculty/progress-to-grade12  -> FacultyController@progressToGrade12  
// - GET  /faculty/student-details/{id} -> FacultyController@getStudentDetails
//
// This file can be deleted - it's just for reference
