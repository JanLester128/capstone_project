- **Comprehensive Grade Tracking**: Displays all 4 quarters and semester grades for each subject
- **Academic Summary**: Provides semester-wise and overall academic performance statistics
- **Print-Friendly Format**: Professional layout optimized for printing
- **Privacy Protection**: Students can only access their own academic data

### 2. **Summer Class Enrollment System**

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### **Backend Components**

#### 1. **FullAcademicYearController.php**
```php
- generateFullYearCOR($studentId): Full academic year data with both semesters
- generateSummerEnrollment($studentId): Summer eligibility and failed subjects
- processSummerEnrollment(): Handle summer class enrollment
```

#### 2. **Database Migration**
```php
- Adds summer enrollment support to existing tables
- Creates summer_class_schedules table for specialized scheduling
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
```

### **Frontend Components**

#### 1. **FullAcademicYearCOR.jsx**
- Displays complete academic year with both semesters
- Shows grades, schedules, and academic summary
- Provides summer enrollment interface for eligible students
- Print-optimized layout with professional formatting

#### 2. **StudentSummerEnrollment.jsx**
- Student-facing summer enrollment interface
- Shows only failed subjects requiring remediation
- Simplified enrollment process without personal data re-entry
- Clear eligibility status and requirements

#### 3. **Enhanced Faculty_Enrollment.jsx**
- Added "Full Year" button alongside existing COR button
- Maintains existing semester-specific COR functionality
- Provides access to both enrollment types

## üîí **Privacy & Security Features**

### **Data Protection Measures**
1. **No Cross-Fetching**: Students can only access their own data
2. **Approved Grades Only**: Only displays grades with `status = 'approved'`
3. **Authentication Required**: All routes protected by authentication middleware
4. **Role-Based Access**: Faculty can access student data, students only their own

### **Privacy Implementation**
```php
// Student accessing their own data
$userId = Auth::id();
$student = Student::where('user_id', $userId)->firstOrFail();

// Only approved grades for privacy
->where('status', 'approved')
```

## üõ£Ô∏è **Route Structure**

### **Faculty Routes**
```php
GET  /faculty/full-year-cor/{studentId}     - Full year COR page
GET  /faculty/full-year-cor/{studentId}     - API: Full year data
GET  /faculty/summer-enrollment/{studentId} - API: Summer eligibility
POST /faculty/summer-enrollment             - API: Process enrollment
```

### **Student Routes**
```php
GET  /student/summer-enrollment    - Summer enrollment page
GET  /student/summer-eligibility   - API: Check eligibility
POST /student/summer-enrollment    - API: Process enrollment
```

## üìä **Database Schema Changes**

### **New Fields Added**
```sql
-- enrollments table
enrollment_type ENUM('regular', 'summer', 'transferee')
summer_subjects JSON
schedule_preference VARCHAR(50)
academic_year_status ENUM('in_progress', 'completed', 'failed', 'summer_required')

-- grades table
is_summer_grade BOOLEAN
original_failed_grade DECIMAL(5,2)
summer_completion_date TIMESTAMP

-- subjects table
is_summer_subject BOOLEAN
summer_duration_weeks INTEGER

-- New table: summer_class_schedules
```
